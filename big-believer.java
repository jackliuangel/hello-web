big believer of frequent release:

	1. archtecure must change to double the release
	2. fail fast to aglin with the user value
	3. reduce the failure dependancy, suppose if this base is wrong....
	4. user does not know the business value, until we put it in production and which is used most

Finally, we can get feedback from user after each small release. That is how we interact with user.


Metric Driven Development

	1. transpanrency. make the goal for the team
	2. cross-understaning of the metric. For example, double release with double resource?
	3. monitor and keep open-minded: releases every 2 weeks? only weekend release?
	4. you can do 5 release a day, but who many regression test?

Metric drives behavivour.

Pod model

	1. must localized, not multi-nation
	2. each one is full-stack, roles can be rotated, not static
	3.  PO, BA, Developer are mandatory. But BA is requried ONLY when process change(BA is NOT just gathering what the user said)
	4.  PO is used to signoff; prioritization
	5. 6-8 is the best size of people
